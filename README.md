# 3ps

3ps is a very basic 3rd party service status amalgamator. It uses Node.js, isomorphic React and MongoDB, and is written in an eclectic mix of basic JavaScript and ECMAScript 6.

Please note that this is a personal project I decided to do in order to learn more about Node.js, NoSQL databases and front end technologies like React. It is not intended for use by anyone else, and especially not in production environments. With that said, if you find it useful then enjoy!
